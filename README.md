# OpenParliament Webscraper üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This project is a web scraper for [OpenParliament.ca](https://openparliament.ca), designed to extract information about Canadian parliamentary bills, their statuses, and related summaries. The project leverages Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup for web scraping and was developed with AI assistance to streamline the development process.

## Features

  - Bill ID and title
  - Status (e.g., Law, Pending, Dormant)
  - Summary and subtitle
  - Sponsor details
  - Related links (e.g., full text of the bill).
- **Generates a structured JSON output**, making the data easy to use in other applications or analyses.
- Built with **support for parallelization** to improve scraping performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Selenium**: For automated browsing.
- **BeautifulSoup (bs4)**: For HTML parsing and data extraction.
- **Chromium and ChromeDriver**: To support Selenium-based automation.
- **Threading and Queue**: For parallelization to speed up the scraping process.
